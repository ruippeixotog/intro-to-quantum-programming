# Quantum Programming: An Introduction

This repository contains the slides of the presentation I gave in August 2019 about some basic concepts of quantum programming.

The presentation is available online [here](https://ruippeixotog.github.io/intro-to-quantum-programming/).

You'll need [reveal-md](https://github.com/webpro/reveal-md) to compile or export the presentation to another format. With that tool installed, you can serve the presentation as a webpage using:

```bash
reveal-md slides.md -w
```

To export a standalone version of the presentation in HTML, including the required resources, run:

```bash
reveal-md slides.md --static $output_path
```
